# Ada Constraint_Error: Off-by-One Array Indexing

This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: accessing array elements outside the defined index range, leading to a `Constraint_Error` exception.

The `bug.ada` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.ada` file provides a corrected version. 

This example showcases the importance of careful array indexing and how easily off-by-one errors can occur.
